# v2.0.0
### Notes
 This is the second version of the Ruby SDK for HPE OneView. It was given support to the major features of OneView, refactor in some of the already existing code, and also a full set of exceptions to make some common exceptions more explicit in the debugging process.
 This version of this SDK officially supports OneView appliances version 2.00.00 or higher, using the OneView Rest API version 200.
 For now only C7000 enclosure types are being supported.

### Major changes
 1. Added full support to the already existing features:
   - Server Profile
   - Server Profile Template
   - Server Hardware
 2. New features added:
   - Connection Templates
   - Datacenter
   - Fabrics
   - Logical downlinks
   - Logical switch groups
   - Logical switches
   - Switches
   - SAN managers
   - Managed SANs
   - Network sets
   - Power devices
   - Racks
   - Server hardware types
   - Unmanaged devices
 3. New exceptions to address the most common issues (Check them in *lib/oneview-sdk/resource/exceptions.rb*)

### Breaking changes
 1. Refactored some method names that may cause incompatibility with older SDK versions. Due to the nature of OneView, the `create` and `delete` methods did not fit the physical infrastructure elements like Enclosures, or Switches, so they now have `add` and `remove` methods that act the same as before, but now it leaves no margin to misunderstand that OneView could actually create these resources. They are:
   - Datacenters
   - Enclosure
   - Power devices
   - Racks
   - Storage systems
   - Storage pools
   - Firmware drivers
   - Firmware bundles (Only `add`)
   - SAN managers
   - Server hardwares
   - Server hardware types
   - Switches
   - Unmanaged devices

### Known issues
The integration tests may warn about 3 issues:

1. OneviewSDK::LogicalInterconnect Firmware Updates perform the actions Stage
> The SDK cannot provide Firmware files for your OneView appliance. Please set a valid SPP in your appliance prior to running this test.

2. OneviewSDK::VolumeTemplate#retrieve! retrieves the resource
> OneView 2.00.00 appliances may return the old type of Volume Template resource. Run it against a newer version of OneView and it should not happen.

3. OneviewSDK::VolumeTemplate#update update volume name
> OneView 2.00.00 appliances may return the old type of Volume Template resource. Run it against a newer version of OneView and it should not happen.
