# Example: Create/Update/Delete fc network
# NOTE: This will create an fc network named 'OneViewSDK Test FC Network', update it and then delete it.

# Supported APIs:
# - API200 for C7000
# - API300 for C7000
# - API300 for Synergy
# - API500 for C7000
# - API500 for Synergy

# api_version = 200 & variant = any to OneviewSDK::API200::FCNetwork
