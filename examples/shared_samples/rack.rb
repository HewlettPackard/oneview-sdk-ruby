require_relative '../_client' # Gives access to @client

# Example: Create/Update/Delete racks
# NOTE: This will create a rack named 'OneViewSDK Test Rack', then delete it.
# NOTE: You'll need to add the following instance variables to the _client.rb file with valid URIs for your environment:
#   @enclosure_name - An enclosure not yet added to any rack
#
# Supported APIs:
# - 200, 300, 500

# Resources that can be created according to parameters:
# api_version = 200 & variant = any to OneviewSDK::API200::Rack
# api_version = 300 & variant = C7000 to OneviewSDK::API300::C7000::Rack
# api_version = 300 & variant = Synergy to OneviewSDK::API300::Synergy::Rack
# api_version = 500 & variant = C7000 to OneviewSDK::API500::C7000::Rack
# api_version = 500 & variant = Synergy to OneviewSDK::API500::Synergy::Rack

# Resource Class used in this sample
rack_class = OneviewSDK.resource_named('Rack', @client.api_version)

# Enclosure class used in this sample
