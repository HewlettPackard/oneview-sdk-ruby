# Examples

Now you can run the example files to test functionality of individual resources.

To test-run these examples, please:
  1. `cd` into this examples directory, then copy the `_client.rb.example` file to a new file named `_client.rb`;
  2. Modify it by inserting your credentials or authentication token, ssl_enabled flag, and anything else your environment requires. The options are commented in the `_client.rb.example` file;
  3. Run `ruby <example_file>.rb`
